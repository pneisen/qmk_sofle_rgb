This is the custom firmware for my Sofle keyboard. It doesn't do anything really special. I built lower, raise, and fn layers
to look a lot like those modes on my Planck so I can move between keyboards easier. 

### Layers
* Base
* Lower - Numbers and Numpad
* Raise - Symbols
* Fn - Function keys and special functions.
